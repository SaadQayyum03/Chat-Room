# Chat-Room üó®Ô∏è

A beginner-friendly introduction to networking in Java. Chat-Room is a rudimentary chat application that can be run locally across devices on the same network. Under the hood, it leverages Java sockets for communication.

## Features

- **Local Networking**: Connect multiple clients on the same local network.
- **User Identification**: Upon first launch, clients choose a username which is used throughout the session.
- **Unique ID Assignment**: Each client receives a unique ID from the server for identification.
- **Message Buffering**: Ensures the last 10 messages are always displayed, offering context in the conversation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

### Compilation & Execution

1. Compile all source files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   java Server
   ```

3. Launch the client application (either on the same PC or a different one on the same network):
   ```bash
   java Client
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Client Initialization**: 
   - When you launch the client for the first time, you'll be prompted to choose a username.
   - This username, alongside a unique ID assigned by the server, represents the client in the chat.

2. **Message Broadcasting**:
   - When you send a message, it's dispatched to the server.
   - The server then broadcasts this message to all connected clients.

3. **Message Buffering**:
   - The application maintains a buffer of the last 10 messages. 
   - Every time you send a message, you'll also see the 10 most recent messages to keep the context of the conversation.

## Extend the Project üöÄ

I have laid the foundational work for a basic chat application, but there's so much more potential to unlock! If you're looking to further develop this project, here are some suggestions:

- **Chat Rooms**: Introduce the concept of chat rooms where clients can either create their own rooms or join pre-existing ones. This allows for segmented conversations based on topics or groups.
  
- **Private Messaging**: Allow clients to send direct messages to another client, bypassing the main chat.
  
- **File Sharing**: Extend the chat's capability to share files, images.
  
- **Authentication**: Integrate a simple authentication mechanism for added security and personalization.
  
- **Emoji Support**: Enhance the chat experience by supporting emojis.

The beauty of open-source projects is the community collaboration. If you have new ideas or want to add new features, we encourage you to fork this project, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Together, we can make this chat application even better!
